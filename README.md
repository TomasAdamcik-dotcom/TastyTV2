## The Project brief

---

## User stories

---

## Wireframes

---

## Used technologies

- CSS
- React

---

## Taken approach

1.  Based on project brief I created user stories with specific user requirements
2.  Based on user stories I created wireframe for visual design
3.  After creating visual design wireframe, I created a diagram of react components for the App. Diagram contains where are components going to be placed within the application
4.  Prepare components as designed in wireframes
5.  Written pseudo code ensuring all functionality required by customer is being implemented
